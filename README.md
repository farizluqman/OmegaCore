## Usage:  

For security reasons **OmegaCore** is installed under **omega** user, hence you need to **su - omega** before checking:    
```
OMEGA_USER=omega #replace omega with the MN username you want to check
su - $OMEGA_USER
omegacoin-cli mnsync status
omegecoin-cli getinfo
omegacoin-cli masternode status
```  
Also, if you want to check/start/stop **OmegaCore** , run one of the following commands as **root**:
```
OMEGA_USER=omega  #replace omega with the MN username you want to check  

systemctl status $OMEGA_USER #To check the service is running.  
systemctl start $OMEGA_USER #To start Omega service.  
systemctl stop $OMEGA_USER #To stop Omega service.  
systemctl is-enabled $OMEGA_USER #To check whetether Omega service is enabled on boot or not.  
```
